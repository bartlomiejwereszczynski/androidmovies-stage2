# Android Developer Fast Track - Project 2

## Popular movies - stage 2

### Setup

only thing needed to build this project is to obtain API key from `https://www.themoviedb.org/`, to do so, create account and request new API key. 
 
copy `~/app/key.properties.dist` to `~/app/key.properties`, then open it and replace `<your_v3_api_key_here>` with your key (don't surround it with `"`), it's done :) now you can build it
